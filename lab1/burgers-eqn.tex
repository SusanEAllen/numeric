\subsection{Burger's Equation and the Navier-Stokes Equations}
\label{lab1:ap:burgers}

\begin{enumerate}
\item begin with the Navier-Stokes equations in 3 dimensions  (these
  equations are an expression of Newton's Second Law, which equates
  mass times acceleration, represented by the advection and $u_t$
  terms, to the force, which is the diffusion).
\item look at flow in only one direction, and ignore pressure effects.
\item describe physical parameters ($\nu=\mu/\rho$, etc.).
\item describe what flows this models.
\end{enumerate}
