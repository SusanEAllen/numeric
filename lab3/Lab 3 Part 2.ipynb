    "So far, the only method we’ve seen for solving systems of linear\n",

    "only one of a class of *direct methods*. This name derives from the fact\n",
    "that the Gaussian Elimination algorithm computes the exact solution\n",
    "*directly*, in a finite number of steps. Other commonly-used direct\n",
    "methods are based on matrix decomposition or factorizations different\n",
    "from the $LU$ decomposition (see Section [2.3.1 Decomposition](#2.3.1-Decomposition)); for\n",
    "example, the $LDL^T$ and Choleski factorizations of a matrix. When the\n",
    "system to be solved is not too large, it is usually most efficient to\n",
    "employ a direct technique that minimizes the effects of round-off error\n",
    "(for example, Gaussian elimination with full pivoting).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the matrices that occur in the discretization of differential\n",
    "equations are typically *very large* and *sparse* – that is, a large\n",
    "proportion of the entries in the matrix are zero. In this case, a direct\n",
    "algorithm, which has a cost on the order of $N^3$ multiplicative\n",
    "operations, will be spending much of its time inefficiently, operating\n",

    "reduce the cost of the solution procedure, down to order $N^2$ for\n",
    "*Jacobi’s method*, the simplest of the iterative methods (see Lab \\#8 )\n",
    "and as low as order $N$ (the optimal order) for *multigrid methods*\n",
    "(which we will not discuss here).\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterative methods are based on the principle of computing an approximate\n",

    "applied to improve the approximation at every iteration. While the exact\n",
    "answer is never reached, it is hoped that the iterative method will\n",

    "arising from differential equations, this is often possible since these\n",
