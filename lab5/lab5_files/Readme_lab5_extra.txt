For E511 ODE track:

I)

Add two new variables (one at a time) to Daisyworld, as specified in
Lab 5 question 9:

Variable 1) Concentration of rabbits that eat daisies
Variable 2) Concentration of foxes that eat rabbits

You'll need to come up with:

a) rabbit and fox birthrates
b) rabbit and fox deathrates
c) a rate at which rabbits eat daisies
d) a rate at which foxes eat rabbits

Note that while we've considered Aw and Ab to be non-dimensional
daisy concentrations (fractions of the planet covered).  They could
just as easily be daisies per square km.  In the same way
a fox "area" of 0.1 could be 0.1 foxes per square km, or
1 fox every 10 square km.

II) Use the steady-state version of your equations to come up with an
analytic expression for Aw, Ab, Af and Ar in terms of a death rate chi
(distinct for each component) and birth rates beta_w = beta_b, beta_f
and beta_r. How broad is the range of initial conditions that produce
this steady state?  What range of death/birth coefficients yield a
steady state where one or both of rabbits and foxes are not extinct?
