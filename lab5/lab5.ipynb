    "\n",
    "### Why Adaptive Stepsize? \n",
    "\n",
    "As a rule of thumb, accuracy increases in Runge-Kutta methods as\n",
    "stepsize decreases. At the same time, the number of function evaluations\n",
    "performed increases. This tradeoff between accuracy of the solution and\n",
    "computational cost always exists, but in the ODE solution algorithms\n",
    "presented earlier it often appears to be unnecessarily large. To see\n",
    "this, consider the solution to a problem in two different time\n",
    "intervals. In the first one, the solution is close to steady, whereas in\n",
    "the second one it changes quickly. For acceptable accuracy with a\n",
    "non-adaptive method the step size will have to be adjusted so that the\n",
    "approximate solution is close to the actual solution in the second\n",
    "interval. The stepsize will be fairly small, so that the approximate\n",
    "solution is able to follow the changes in the solution here. However, as\n",
    "there is no change in stepsize throughout the solution process, the same\n",
    "step size will be applied to approximate the solution in the first time\n",
    "interval, where clearly a much larger stepsize would suffice to achieve\n",
    "the same accuracy. Thus, in a region where the solution behaves nicely a\n",
    "lot of function evaluations are wasted because the stepsize is chosen in\n",
    "accordance with the most quickly changing part of the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way to address this problem is the use of adaptive stepsize control.\n",
    "This class of algorithms adjusts the stepsize taken in a time interval\n",
    "according to the properties of the solution in that interval, making it\n",
    "useful for producing a solution that has a given accuracy in the minimum\n",
    "number of steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Designing Adaptive Stepsize Control\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the goal is clear, the question remains of how to close in on\n",
    "it. As mentioned above, an adaptive algorithm is usually asked to solve\n",
    "a problem to a desired accuracy. To be able to adjust the stepsize in\n",
    "Runge-Kutta the algorithm must therefore calculate some estimate of how\n",
    "far its solution deviates from the actual solution. If with its initial\n",
    "stepsize this estimate is already well within the desired accuracy, the\n",
    "algorithm can proceed with a larger stepsize. If the error estimate is\n",
