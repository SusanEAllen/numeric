    "Round-off Error and Discretization Error {#lab2:sec:accuracy}\n",
    "----------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "From Example [lab2:exm:accuracy] and the example in the Forward Euler\n",
    "section of the previous lab,  it is obvious that a numerical\n",
    "approximation is exactly that - **an approximation**. The process of\n",
    "discretizing a differential equation inevitably leads to errors. In this\n",
    "section, we will tackle two fundamental questions related to the\n",
    "accuracy of a numerical approximation:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Where does the error come from (and how can we measure it)?\n",
    "\n",
    "-   How can the error be controlled?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where does the error come from?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Round-off error:\n",
    "\n",
    "When attempting to solve differential equations on a computer, there are\n",
    "two main sources of error. The first, *round-off error*, derives from\n",
    "the fact that a computer can only represent real numbers by *floating\n",
    "point* approximations, which have only a finite number of digits of\n",
    "accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we all know that the number $\\pi$ is a non-repeating\n",
    "decimal, which to the first twenty significant digits is\n",
    "$3.1415926535897932385\\dots$ Imagine a computer which stores only eight\n",
    "significant digits, so that the value of $\\pi$ is rounded to\n",
    "$3.1415927$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many situations, these five digits of accuracy may be sufficient.\n",
    "However, in some cases, the results can be catastrophic, as shown in the\n",
    "following example: $$\\frac{\\pi}{(\\pi + 0.00000001)-\\pi}.$$ Since the\n",
    "computer can only “see” 8 significant digits, the addition\n",
    "$\\pi+0.00000001$ is simply equal to $\\pi$ as far as the computer is\n",
    "concerned. Hence, the computed result is $\\frac{1}{0}$ - an undefined\n",
    "expression! The exact answer $100000000\\pi$, however, is a very\n",
    "well-defined non-zero value.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Truncation error:\n",
    "\n",
    "The second source of error stems from the discretization of the problem,\n",
    "and hence is called *discretization error* or *truncation error*. In\n",
    "comparison, round-off error is always present, and is independent of the\n",
    "discretization being used. The simplest and most common way to analyse\n",
    "the truncation error in a scheme is using *Taylor series expansions*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us begin with the forward difference formula for the first\n",
    "derivative, , which involves the discrete solution at times $t_{i+1}$\n",
    "and $t_{i}$. Since only continuous functions can be written as Taylor\n",
    "series, we expand the exact solution (instead of the discrete values\n",
    "$T_i$) at the discrete point $t_{i+1}$:\n",
    "$$T(t_{i+1}) = T(t_i+\\dt) = T(t_i) + (\\Delta t) T^\\prime(t_i) + \n",
    "  \\frac{1}{2}(\\Delta t)^2 T^{\\prime\\prime}(t_i) +\\cdots,\n",
    "%%+   \\frac{1}{6}(\\dt)^3   y^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}(t_i) + \\cdots$$ We can\n",
    "then subtract $T(t_i)$ and divide the result by $\\Delta t$ in order to\n",
    "obtain $$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "  \\frac{T(t_{i+1})-T(t_i)}{\\Delta t} &=& T^{\\prime}(t_i) +\n",
    "  \\underbrace{\\frac{1}{2}(\\Delta t) T^{\\prime\\prime}(t_i) + \\cdots}\n",
    "_{\\mbox{\\rm truncation error}} \\nonumber \\\\ \\; \\nonumber \\\\\n",
    "%%+    \\frac{1}{6}(\\dt)^2   y^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}(t_i) + \\cdots} \n",
    "  &=& T^{\\prime}(t_i) + {\\cal O}(\\Delta t).\n",
    "  \\label{lab2:eq:disc-error}\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This second expression writes the truncation error term in terms of\n",
    "*order notation*. If we write $y = {\\cal O}(\\Delta t)$, then we mean\n",
    "simply that $y<c \\cdot \\Delta t$ for some constant $c$, and we say that\n",
    "“ *$y$ is first order in $\\Delta t$*” (since it depends on $\\Delta t$ to\n",
    "the first power) or “ *$y$ is big-oh of $\\Delta t$*.” As $\\Delta t$ is\n",
    "assumed small, the next term in the series, $\\Delta t^2$ is small\n",
    "compared to the $\\Delta t$ term.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is clear from that as $\\Delta t$ is reduced in size (as the\n",
    "computational grid is refined), the error is also reduced. If you\n",
    "remember that we derived the approximation from the limit definition of\n",
    "derivative, then this should make sense. This dependence of the error on\n",
    "powers of the grid spacing $\\Delta t$ is an underlying characteristic of\n",
    "difference approximations, and we will see approximations with higher\n",
    "orders in the coming sections …\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one more important distinction to be made here. The “truncation\n",
    "error” we have been discussing so far is actually what is called *local\n",
    "truncation error*. It is “local” in the sense that we have expanded the\n",
    "Taylor series *locally* about the exact solution at the point $t_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a *global truncation error* (or, simply, *global error*),\n",
    "which is the error made during the course of the entire computation,\n",
    "from time $t_0$ to time $t_n$. The difference between local and global\n",

    "but no similar analysis is available for the global error. We can write\n",
    "$$\\mbox{\\rm global error} = |T(t_n)-T_n|$$ (see\n",
    "Figure [lab2:fig:truncation-error]), but this expression can only be\n",
    "evaluated if the exact solution is known ahead of time (which is not the\n",
    "case in most problems we want to compute, since otherwise we wouldn’t be\n",

    "Now that we’ve determined the source of the error in numerical methods,\n",
    "we would like to find a way to control it; that is, we would like to be\n",
    "able to compute and be confident that our approximate solution is\n",
    "“close” to the exact solution. Round-off error is intrinsic to all\n",
    "numerical computations, and cannot be controlled (except to develop\n",
    "methods that do not magnify the error unduly … more on this later).\n",
    "Truncation error, on the other hand, *is* under our control.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the simple ODE examples that we’re dealing with in this lab, the\n",
    "round-off error in a calculation is much smaller than the truncation\n",
    "error. Furthermore, the schemes being used are *stable with respect to\n",
    "round-off error* in the sense that round-off errors are not magnified in\n",
    "the course of a computation. So, we will restrict our discussion of\n",
    "error control in what follows to the truncation error.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are many numerical algorithms in which the round-off\n",
    "error can dominate the the result of a computation (Gaussian elimination\n",
    "is one example, which you will see in Lab \\#3 ), and so we must always\n",
    "keep it in mind when doing numerical computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two fundamental ways in which the truncation error in an\n",
    "approximation  can be reduced:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Decrease the grid spacing, . Provided that the second derivative of\n",
    "    the solution is bounded, it is clear from the error term in  that as\n",
    "      is reduced, the error will also get smaller. This principle was\n",
    "    demonstrated in an example from Lab \\#1. The disadvantage to\n",
    "    decreasing  is that the cost of the computation increases since more\n",
    "    steps must be taken. Also, there is a limit to how small  can be,\n",
    "    beyond which round-off errors will start polluting the computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Increase the order of the approximation. We saw above that the\n",
    "    forward difference approximation of the first derivative is first\n",
    "    order accurate in the grid spacing. It is also possible to derive\n",
    "    higher order difference formulas which have a leading error term of\n",
    "    the form $(\\dt)^p$, with $p>1$. You should have discovered already\n",
    "    in Problem [lab2:prob:taylor] that the centered difference formula\n",

    "    Section [lab2:sec:highorder-taylor]. The main disadvantage to using\n",
    "    very high order schemes is that the error term depends on higher\n",

    "    this case, the stability of the scheme can be adversely affected\n",
