\section{Summary}
\label{lab2:sec:summary}

This lab has discussed the accuracy and stability of difference
schemes for simple first order ODEs.  
The results of the problems should have made it clear to you that
choosing an accurate and stable discretization for even a very simple
problem is not straightforward.  
One must take into account not only the considerations of accuracy and
stability, but also the cost or complexity of the scheme.
Selecting a numerical method for a
given problem can be considered as an art in itself.
